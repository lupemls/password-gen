# password-gen
This responsive site will prompt a user for a desired length (between 8 and 128), and desired character types (lowercase, capital, symbols, and/or numbers), and generate a password based off that criteria, checking to make sure they use at least one character type and are within the acceptable length. It will write the password to the page.
